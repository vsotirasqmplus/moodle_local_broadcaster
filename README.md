# moodle_local_broadcaster
* When you want to broadcast contents such as messages and links to a course category or a cohort,
to the users' dashboard, to the site home, to certain module view pages,
for guests, logged-in users or the visitors, when messages or links are time restricted,
so you want to set and forget, this can be a tool to help you broadcast multiple messages
as header or footer additions to the targeted pages / courses / cohorts.

* Site admins can enable / disable page types (site, dashboard, module),
where course category managers can manage the broadcasting page contents.
Each page belongs to a page type, and you can have multiple broadcasting pages for each type
having their own contents, time restrictions, audience targeting.

* If new modules are installed in your Moodle, the new module can be selected on a new record and added to the type list.
Then you can manage the new Page Type as a site admin before you can enable it and manage the associated broadcasting pages. 

* The main link to manage the resources appears on the Profile page under Misc options.
If you do not see it, then you do not have category or site management capabilities.
* Javascript inside the Atto editor is processed as normal inside \<script> tags, 
* AXAJ calls still require capabilities by the current user to present requested contents or errors are returned.
* Happy broadcasting.
